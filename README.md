### Hey ðŸ‘‹

My name is Larissa and I am a student of web development!
I am currently focused on learning web front-end focusing on UI Design and JavaScript (and their libraries). 
I am working on personal projects to develop a rich and well-structured portfolio. 
In addition to programming, I love Design and sometimes illustrate in my spare time.
